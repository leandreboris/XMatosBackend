It concerns the Django Restful API for XMATOS 

To be used a superuser needs to be created
We provided a virtual environment to ease the integrations



Below the folders created and their meanings : 

1- Analytics is used to track a user data [ IP adress (mainly) ] when he checks an article 
2- Codes is used to generate a code for a second security authentification 
3- Entities contains the classes related to the generics Ecommerce classes
4- Profile updates is used to manage modification of the users profiles (Used to make the code less tedious)
5- Social auth concerns the Oauth part with certain social media such as Google and Facebook
6- geoip is used to track the data that derive from an IP adress
7- static is for all static files
8- Users is used to define everything relative to the different types of users of the website [Permissions, Login, Registration, ...]



--- It's necessary to provide the credentials for the Facebook API
--- The views related to Login in Users need to be modified later because we work on a local mode
--- Don't forget the CORS policy in the settings
